# AI Design Linter

A comprehensive Figma plugin that automatically analyses your designs against design system standards and provides intelligent linting for consistency, accessibility, and best practices.

## üéØ Features

- **Design Token Validation**: Automatically detects hardcoded colours, typography, and spacing that should use design tokens
- **Component Usage Analysis**: Ensures proper component usage and instance overrides
- **Typography Consistency**: Validates font sizes, weights, and line heights against design system standards
- **Colour System Checks**: Identifies non-standard colours and suggests design token replacements
- **Spacing Validation**: Ensures consistent spacing using design system spacing tokens
- **Auto-Fix Capabilities**: Automatically applies design tokens and fixes common issues
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant feedback on selected layers with detailed issue reporting

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (download from https://nodejs.org/)
- Figma Desktop App

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env file with your Figma credentials
   # Get your Figma token from: https://www.figma.com/developers/api#authentication
   ```

4. Build the plugin:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. In Figma, go to Plugins ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Import plugin from manifest
6. Select the `manifest.json` file from this directory

### Development

To develop and test the plugin:

1. Run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:
   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

2. In Figma, reload the plugin to see changes

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Select Layers**: Choose the layers, frames, or components you want to analyse
2. **Run Analysis**: Click "Analyse Selection" in the plugin panel
3. **Review Issues**: The plugin will show all design inconsistencies found
4. **Apply Fixes**: Use "Apply Fix" buttons to automatically correct issues where possible
5. **Navigate**: Use "Zoom to Layer" to quickly locate problematic elements

## üìã Design Rules

The linter checks for:

- **Colour Tokens**: Hardcoded colours that should use design system tokens
- **Typography**: Non-standard font sizes, weights, and line heights
- **Component Usage**: Proper use of design system components
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing using design tokens
- **Button Styles**: Correct primary/secondary button styling
- **Accessibility**: Colour contrast and text sizing standards

## üîß Configuration

### Configuration

The plugin supports multiple configuration methods:

#### Method 1: UI Configuration (Recommended)
1. Open the Design Linter plugin in Figma
2. Click the "‚öôÔ∏è Configuration" button
3. Enter your Figma Personal Access Token
4. Verify the File Key (defaults to Design Kit)
5. Click "Save Configuration"

Your settings are automatically saved and will persist between sessions.

#### Method 2: Environment Variables (Advanced)
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
# Figma Personal Access Token
FIGMA_TOKEN=your_figma_personal_access_token_here

# Design Kit File Key (default: KkqX7OKAggFzvfB0CMUwBz)
FIGMA_FILE_KEY=KkqX7OKAggFzvfB0CMUwBz

# Figma API Base URL
FIGMA_API_BASE_URL=https://api.figma.com/v1
```

**To use environment variables:**
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Figma token
2. Run `npm run build:config` to inject the variables into the plugin
3. The plugin will automatically use the values from your `.env` file

**Note**: You must run the build script after updating your `.env` file for changes to take effect.

### Design System Integration

The plugin automatically reads your Figma file's design system:
- Colour styles and tokens
- Text styles and typography
- Component definitions
- Spacing and layout tokens

**Note**: The `.env` file is gitignored to protect your credentials from being committed to version control.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Plugin not loading**: Ensure you've built the plugin with `npm run build`
- **Analysis errors**: Check that selected layers are not locked or in read-only components
- **Font loading issues**: Some text layers with mixed fonts cannot be auto-fixed

## üìö Development

This plugin is built with:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Figma Plugin API for design analysis
- Modern ES6+ features for optimal performance

### Building

```bash
# Build once
npm run build

# Watch for changes
npm run watch

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```
